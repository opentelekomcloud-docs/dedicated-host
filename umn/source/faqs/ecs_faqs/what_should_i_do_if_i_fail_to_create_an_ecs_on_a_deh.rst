What Should I Do If I Fail to Create an ECS on a DeH?
=====================================================

The following may cause the failure in creating an ECS on a DeH:

-  The ECS flavor you selected is not supported by your DeH.

   To avoid this, select an ECS flavor that is supported by your DeH. For the ECS flavors supported by each DeH type, see :ref:`Overview <deh_01_0005>`.

-  Your DeH resources are insufficient.

   You can check whether the remaining vCPU resources and memory size of your DeH are sufficient for creating an ECS with the specifications you selected. If the resources are insufficient, you need to apply for more DeH resources or delete some ECSs from your DeH.
