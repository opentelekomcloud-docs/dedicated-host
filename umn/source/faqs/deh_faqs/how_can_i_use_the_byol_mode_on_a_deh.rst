How Can I Use the BYOL Mode on a DeH?
=====================================

Perform the following steps:

#. Check whether the license terms and conditions allow you to use the software license on DeHs. Contact the software license provider to confirm whether your existing license can be used on the DeHs. If yes, go to the next step.
#. Submit a review form to your software license provider. You can obtain the values of DeH parameters, such as vCPUs, memory size, sockets, and physical cores, form on the DeH console.
