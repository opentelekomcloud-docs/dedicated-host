How Do I Bring My Own Licenses to a DeH?
========================================

To use your own licenses on a DeH, do as follows:

#. Check whether the license terms and conditions allow you to use the software license on DeHs. Contact the software license provider to confirm whether your existing license can be used on the DeHs. If yes, go to the next step.
#. Submit a review form to your software license provider. You can obtain the values of DeH parameters, such as vCPUs, memory size, sockets, and physical cores, from the DeH console.
