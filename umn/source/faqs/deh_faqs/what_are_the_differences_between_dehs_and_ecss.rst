What Are the Differences Between DeHs and ECSs?
===============================================

DeHs are dedicated physical servers where the virtualization environment is deployed and are fully dedicated for your use. Your DeHs are physically isolated from those of other users. After creating a DeH, you can create ECSs on the DeH as well as plan physical server resources.

Common ECSs allow multiple users to share physical server resources.
