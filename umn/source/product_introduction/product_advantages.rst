Product Advantages
==================

-  Cost-effectiveness: DeH allows you to bring your own license (BYOL), such as licenses for Microsoft Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Office, to reduce licensing costs.
-  Security: DeH isolates compute resources to prevent your workloads on DeHs from being affected by those of other tenants.
-  Legal compliance: Physically isolated DeHs help you meet regulation compliance and surveillance requirements for your sensitive services.
-  Flexibility: A DeH can be allocated within several minutes, allowing you to buy one at any time you want.
-  Reliability: DeH provides 99.95% availability.
-  Automatic recovery: If a DeH is faulty, all ECSs on the faulty DeH are automatically migrated to another idle DeH in the resource pool and the idle DeH will be associated to the user.
