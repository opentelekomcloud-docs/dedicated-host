Dedicated Host
==============

Dedicated Host (DeH) is a service that provides dedicated physical hosts. You can create Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs) on a DeH to enhance the isolation, security, and performance of your ECSs. When you migrate services to a DeH, you can continue to use your server software licenses used before the migration. That is, you can use the Bring Your License (BYOL) feature on the DeH to reduce costs and independently manage your ECSs.
